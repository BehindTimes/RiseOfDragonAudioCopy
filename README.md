The RoDData.xml has a list of every dialog in the game, the amount of time it should be played, and any Sega PCM Audio files associated with it.

The audio.csv is a small (less organized) file that keeps track of what audio files belong to what dialogs.  This will be helpful trying to break up or combine audio.  Just look for anything more than 3 colums (audio file, scene file, dialog number), and that will show you what problematic audio files need to be worked on, and what audio files haven't been associated yet.

While this isn't ready for primetime, it should be a start to help get the ScummVM version of Rise of the Dragon to use the Sega CD voice acting after these issues are corrected.
